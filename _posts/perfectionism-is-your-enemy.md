excerpt: "One of the things I struggle with."

Perfection is hard to imagine, yet we try anyway.
We try ideas in our head, settle on something that looks like it could be "it"...

But then we always find a flaw, a reason it could fail.
So we discard it and continue our search for the holy grail.

This cycle perpetuates until we:

1. 🪦 die
2. 😖 give up on the initiative entirely
3. 👍 curb our perfectionism

Letting go of the perfectionistic mindset allows us to start doing.
Doing something crappy...
But everything done for the first time is going to be crappy.
And that's okay. We won't stop here. That's just a stepping stone to something greater.

Don't just sit in your head. Start throwing things at the wall and see what sticks.
