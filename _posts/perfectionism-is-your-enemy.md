excerpt: "One of the things I struggle with."

Perfect work is hard to achieve or even imagine.
If that's the case, then we should do it "tomorrow" when we are more "ready".
But then tomorrow comes and we are not any more "ready" than we were yesterday.

This cycle perpetuates until we:

1. 🪦 die
2. 😖 give up on the idea
3. 👍 curb our perfectionism

Let go of the perfectionistic mindset and start producing something crappy.
Everything done for the first time is going to be crappy.
But that's okay. That's just a stepping stone to something greater.
